"""
A semiprime number is an integer which can be expressed as a product of two distinct primes. For example 15 = 3*5 is a semiprime number but 9 = 3*3 is not .
Given an integer number N, find whether it can be expressed as a sum of two semi-primes or not (not necessarily distinct).

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer N.

Output Format:
Print 'Yes' if it is possible to represent N as a sum of two semiprimes 'No' otherwise.

Example:

Input:
30

Output:
Yes

Explanation:
N = 30 can be expressed as 15+15 where 15 is a semi-prime number (5*3 = 15)

NOTE: N is less than equal to 200
